-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

95% of the included installers (.exe's) are up to date as of 10.16.2013
All version numbers have been included for the installers that had this
information readily available from their download page. All other .exe's
may not be ENTIRELY up to date because of typical update issues (ie: stupid interface change, unreliability, etc...)
but they will work their magic none the less. Additionally, some features have been removed temporarily for
stability concerns or will be available in other versions.

Below is a description of what's included, their functions, in order of folder
structure. Then in order of importance, or suggested run order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Quickplay retro games on Dosbox
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your unfamiliar with DosBox or basic versions of Windows then you will want to know that in order to play games (included on this cd)
you will want to obviously load the DosBox. When you get to the command line you will want to use this example, verbatim.

C:\> cd \doom
C:\DOOM>doom

The first line opens the game folder.
The second command opens the game file.
All games are listed in the "Games" folder on the root directory and can be opened by replacing "Doom" in the example
with the first word (and number) of the desired game. ie: Prince, Arena, Paperboy, Pacman, etc...

*You may need to adjust dos box settings (X:\Games\DOSBox\Data\settings\dosbox.txt) in order for the game to have proper resolution and sound
on your specific computer. However optimal/universal settings have already been configured.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AntiVirus Folder:

~ Avast! AntiVirus 2014. A robust antivirus program that includes a boottime scan.
This will scan your PC for viruses BEFORE they have a chance to kick in.
Auto update, when you register you get protection for 365 days. This program
runs best on Vista/7 or with 3+ GB RAM.

~ Avira AntiVirus. Much like Avast in that it's a reliable program for keeping
the bugs away. Includes some scan features but runs best on those dated systems
like XP or running < 2GB RAM. Due to a couple notifications, it's free for life.

~ Ccleaner 4.0.6. This stands for Cookie cleaner. I've seen it remove as much as
30GB of data from a computer who's user prolly never cleaned out their browsing
history. It includes a couple other feature which I highly recommend checking out!

~ Tweaking.com's Windows All In One Repair Tool. Seriously guys? You couldn't
find a LONGER name? Anyways, similar to Ccleaner in that it has some check box's
that determine how basic/thorough your repair is. I've had good luck repairing
WIFI connections and repairing the SAFE MODE feature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VirusRemoval Folder:

~ MalwareBytesAntiMalware. (MWB) The name is a little redundant, makes for a pain for
a project like this. MAKE SURE to run the up-to-date virus definitions. (MBAM)
As a virus removal program isn't worth anything if it can't remove the latest crap.

~ SuperAntiSpyware. (SAS) Doesn't have any MANUAL definition updates that I'm aware
 of in the freeware version. UPDATE it if you have a valid internet connection. I suggest
running a scan of BOTH MWB & SAS for complete virus removal. As I've seen it
take multiple simultaneous passes of both programs to completely remove some
exploits.

~ TDSSKiller. Finds and removes rootkits. Usually takes less than 1 minute to
run. Consider even 1-2 exploits an accomplishment. Rootkits are less common
but can cause some pretty wonky effects. They are often missed by MWB/SAS/Others.

~ Rkill. This is a temporary fix. It will find alot of currently running
malware/rootkits/exploits and kill their processes or services. Very effective
on MoneyPak or exploits that prevent end-user from using the system like normal.

~ HitMan Pro 3. I don't use this very often because it REQUIRES updates to run.
Which isn't always an option when you can't get online due to a virus. However
I have seen it remove the infamous MoneyPak virus where MWB/SAS failed.

~ FixExe/SASFixEXE. These are used when a virus corrupts an operating system
(OS) in a way that disables any programs (shortcuts, .exe's, etc...) from
running. Likely resulting in frequent errors when trying to run any program.

~ Unhide. Much like the previous "FIXexe." Unhide repairs damage done to a
computer through a particular virus. In this case when folders or files go
missing, Unhide is what will bring them back. DO NOT run ccleaner before hand,
as it may delete some of the hidden files. INCLUDING any pictures, docs, etc...
that may be hidden.

~ ComboFix. Not my favorite program, I use it as a last resort because I've seen
it nuke computers before. On the other hand it can remove viruses, rootkits, and
has been known to repair internet connections.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AntiVirusRemoval:

~ These are all programs that THOROUGHLY remove the specified AV program.
Useful when changing AV and/or when an AV blocks your current internet settings
to the point of annoyance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diagnosis:

~ Burnin Test. This is a stress test (see options) for your computer as a whole.
Use to diagnose BlueScreens of Death, hardware, overheating, etc...

~ CPU-Z. Just one of many programs that list your current computers specifications.
RAM, CPU, Graphics Card, etc...

~ Speccy. A slick looking interface that again, provides your current computers
specifications.

~ Diagnostic Flow Chart. This is just a .jpg I whipped up that provides the
proper diagnostic STEPS of thoroughly diagnosing and PC. Aimed towards the
Computer Technician. Start in the middle with "Does it power on?"
Every checkpoint is asking a question and could potentially be the answer. You never want to STOP there though.
For instance a computer can have a bad capacitor, and still have viruses.

AC: AC adapter, try one you know is good.
DC: DC Jack, is it overly loose? Crooked? Too far in?
CAPS: Capacitors, it's easy to tell if one has blown.
PS: PowerSupply, try one you know is good. Make sure you have all connections.
CARDS: I've had cards go bad that don't allow the system to boot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nirsoft:

~N

~ BlueScreenView. Provides a detailed description of recent BSOD.

~ WebPassView. See any saved passwords that may be stored in the cookies of any
web browser. Internet Explorer (IE) Google Chrome (GC) FireFox (FF) etc...

~ MyLastSearch. Gives a list of recent search queries. Acts as a small keylogger
for previously mentioned browsers.

~ As for the rest, try them out or go to Nirsoft for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recovery:

~ ProduKey. Also a Nirsoft utility. You want to totally wipe and reinstall your
operating system but you don't want to lose the produkeys for software you
have purchased over the years? This is what you need. Sometimes you will need
to point the program to the C:\windows location in order to get results.

~ JellyBeanKey. When produkey doesn't work, use this. Works much the same way
but I find it to be less effective sometimes.

~ Recuva. Emptied your recycling bin? Trying to find long deleted files for a
friend? Recuva is a live operating program that performs pretty well at recovering
long lost files of all types. It can take a few hours, depending on your search
settings but will likely do the trick. MAKE SURE to recover files to a
jump drive/external HDD because if you recover to the same drive, then you take
the chance of OVERWRITING the very data your trying to recover.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ninite.exe:

Both of these .exe files will auto download and install the latest version of;

~ FireFox
~ Google Chrome
~ Silverlight, Java, Shockwave Runtimes. (internet browser games/videos, etc...)
~ Klite codecs (needed when you have video but no sound)
~ 7zip (needed to extract ALOT of internet file downloads)
~ Revo (program uninstaller that also removes registry entries and more)
~ Teamview (secure Remote Access)
~ VLC (better alternative to microsoft's Media Player)
~ Microsoft's .NET framework
~ CDBurnerXP (MUCH more robust and effective CD burner to the one built into Windows)
~ MWB, SAS

~ Depending one which ninite.exe you choose one is WITH Avast! The other is
WithOUT Avast!
